[By The Sword Linked](https://www.bytheswordlinked.uk/) is an experimental project to create a new finding aid and reference work about the British Civil Wars (c.1639-1660). It uses Semantic MediaWiki to publish structured data and free text. Most users should be able to find named entities and related sources using search suggestions and following links through the wiki without having to use SPARQL.

[Introductory blog post](https://bytheswordlinked.hcommons.org/2019/02/26/introduction/) explains the aims and scope of the project.
